public class Testingre {

Good morning sir/mam,
Myself B.Rajeshwari
 I am currently working in XCEL CORP as a software test engineer. I joined this company 12 months back as a fresher. 
During the last 12 months i have been involved in 5projects where i was a part of testing team. 
I have executed a project in software testing where I used automation testing tool Selenium,appium  to automate some of the commonly used features of the application.                                                                                                                                                                     in my current projects I am testing a web based application designed to be used in storing the school management educational details application and course application . This is a very complex application and I am learning a lot of things in this domain. 
I have written test cases for the manual execution and reported defects in zentao. I have good knowledge of manual
testing,functional and non-functional testing and Automation Testing. I use automation tools such as selenium for testing repetitive test areas of my application. I have also used Zento tool for test management and defect reporting. I have successfully performed testing like functional testing, smoke, sanity testing, re-testing, regression tessting etc. i have also done performance testing using Jmeter tool and using postman for API testing.

Java is an object-oriented programming language.

  Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects,
 along with its attributes and methods. 
 For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

   A Class  "blueprint" for creating objects.

  static method, which means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, 
   public, which can only be accessed by objects:

What is a classes in Java?
A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

What is method in Java?
A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. 
 Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

What is array in Java?
used to store a multiple values in single variable,instead of declaring seperate variables for each value.
to declare arn array ,define the variable type with square brackets 
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objectswq	

What is recursion in Java?
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. 

function:
A function is a method that does have a return value. 
To define a method to be a function, set its return type to be the type of the value it is returning. 
An example of a built-in function in Java is Math. pow() 


public	The code is accessible for all classes	
private	The code is only accessible within the declared class	
default	The code is only accessible in the same package. 	
protected The code is accessible in the same package tests subclasses.

Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another 
   	 The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class.
 	In addition, it can have its own properties and methods. 
	An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.

Why is polymorphism important in OOP?
Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
 Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

What is abstraction vs encapsulation?
Abstraction is the process or method of gaining the information. 
While encapsulation is the process or method to contain the information.
 In abstraction, problems are solved at the design or interface level.
 While in encapsulation, problems are solved at the implementation level.

What is overloading and overriding?
 When two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters, it's called Overloading.
 When the method signature(name and parameters)are the same in the superclass and the child class,it's called Overriding.

What is difference between encapsulation and abstraction?
Abstraction is the method of hiding the unwanted information. 
Whereas encapsulation is a method to hide the data in a single entity or unit along with a method to protect information from outside. 
We can implement abstraction using abstract class and interfaces

What do you mean by encapsulation?
encapsulation describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, like a class in Java.
 This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state of an object from the outside. This is called information hiding.

Which class called abstract?
Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects

Abstraction in Java
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

What are collections what collections you have used?
  The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
  Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.
  Java Collection means a single unit of objects.

diff bet list and set?
  List is an ordered sequence of elements. User can easily access element present at specific index and can insert 
 element easily at specified index. 
Set is an unordered list of elements. 
Set does not have duplicate elements

The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods,
 which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override). 
The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...). 
The final keyword is called a "modifier".
The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user. The java final keyword can be used in many context. Final can be: variable; method; class.


What is hard and soft assertion?
A Hard Assertion is a type of assertion that throws an exception immediately when an assert statement fails. 
Test steps after hard assertion will not be executed and the next test in the test suite will start.
 Soft Assertions are the type of assertions that do not throw an exception immediately when an assertion fails.02

Desired Capabilities is a class used to declare a set of basic requirements 
such as combinations of browsers, operating systems, browser versions, etc. 
to perform automated cross browser testing of a web application.

How do I use keyboard events?
Image result for How we can use key event operation ?
There are three different keyboard events in JavaScript: 
keydown : Keydown happens when the key is pressed down, and auto repeats if the key is pressed down for long. 
keypress : This event is fired when an alphabetic, numeric, or punctuation key is pressed down. 
keyup : Keyup happens when the key is released.

An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to describe a 
behavior that classes must implement. 
They are similar to protocols. 
Interfaces are declared using the interface keyword,
 and may only contain method signature and constant declarations. 

How does XPath work in Selenium?
XPath is a technique in Selenium to navigate through the HTML structure of a page. 
XPath enables testers to navigate through the XML structure of any document, 
and this can be used on both HTML and XML documents.

The major disadvantage of using Absolute XPath Expressions is 'Due to small changes in the UI, 
the Absolute XPath Expression of a UI element may change and won't work.

diff between class and objects?
 Object is an instance of a class. Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created. 
Object is a real world entity such as pen, laptop, mobile, bed, keyboard, mouse, chair etc. 
Class is a group of similar objects

What is XML is used for?
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is used to describe data. The XML standard is a flexible way to
create information formats 
and electronically share structured data via the public internet, 
as well as via corporate networks.  

DOM stands for Document Object Model. In the world of web, all HTML webpages are referred to as documents. 
The Document Object Model represents each of these web pages in a tree-like structure to make it easier to access
 and manage the elements..

What is a Test case?
A test case has components that describe input, action, and an expected response, in order to determine if a feature of an application works correctly.
A test case is a set of instructions on “HOW” to validate a particular test objective/target, which, when followed will tell us if the expected behavior of the system is satisfied or not.
Regression testing is a type of software testing. Test cases are re-executed to check the previous functionality of the application is working fine, and the new changes have not produced any bugs. 

s/w
Software testing is the process of finding errors in the developed product. 
It also checks whether the real outcomes can match expected results,
 as well as aids in the identification of defects, missing requirements, or gaps.

Locators are the way to identify an HTML element on a web page,
 and almost all UI automation tools provide the capability to use locators 
for the identification of HTML elements on a web page.

Grid
What is Selenium Grid? Selenium Grid is a smart proxy server 
that makes it easy to run tests in parallel on multiple machines. This is done by routing commands 
to remote web browser instances, where one server acts as the hub. 
This hub routes test commands that are in JSON format to multiple registered Grid nodes.

8. What is black box testing? What are the different black box testing techniques?
Black box testing is the software testing method which is used to test the software 
without knowing the internal structure of code or program. 
This testing is usually done to check the functionality of an application.
 The different black box testing techniques are

Unit tests: These are written by software developers and test a unit of code in isolation.
Integration tests: These test how well different software components work with each other.
Regression tests: Verify that the new code didn't break any existing functionality.
Performance tests: Ensure that the software won't crash and perform reasonably under heavy load or 
stringent conditions.
UI tests: Ensure that the software uses a consistent user experience and no visual or graphical elements 
on the screen are broken.

What are integration and unit tests?
Unit testing means testing individual modules of an application in isolation
(without any interaction with dependencies) to confirm that the code is doing things right. 
Integration testing means checking if different modules are working fine when combined together as a group.

What is TestNG for Selenium?
TestNG in Selenium is a Java testing framework, inspired by JUnit and NUnit. It overcomes the constraints and
 disadvantages of JUnit and introduces an entirely new set of properties, making TestNG more powerful and easy to use.

Data Driven Testing
Data Driven Testing is a software testing method in which test data is stored in table or spreadsheet format. 
Data driven testing allows testers to input a single test script that can execute tests for 
all test data from a table and expect the test output in the same table. 
It is also  called table-driven testing or parameterized testing.
   
Data Driven Framework
Data Driven Framework is an automation testing framework in which input values are read from data files 
and stored into variables in test scripts. It enables testers to build both positive and 
negative test cases into a single test. Input data in data driven framework can be stored
in single or multiple data sources like .xls, .xml, .csv and databases.

What is difference between assert and verify?
Assert: If the assert condition is true then the program control will execute the next test step,
but if the condition is false, the execution will stop and further test step will not be executed. whereas, 
Verify: There won't be any halt in the test execution even though the verify condition is true or false.

What is the difference between actions and action in Selenium?
Image result
With the above explanations of Actions Class & Action Class, 
we can now conclude that Actions is a class that is based on a builder design pattern. 
This is a user-facing API for emulating complex user gestures. 
Whereas Action is an Interface which represents a single user-interaction action.

What is the difference between find element and find elements?
findElement: This command is used to uniquely identify a web element within the web page.
findElements: This command is used to uniquely identify the list of web elements within the web page

What is the difference between quit and close in Selenium?
The difference between quit() and close()

driver. quit() : The quit() method quits the driver, closing every associated window. driver. 
close() : The close() method closes the currently focused window, quitting the driver if the current window is the only open window.

What is the difference between setSpeed () and sleep () methods?
Your answer

The main difference between them is that: setSpeed sets a speed that will apply a delay time before every Selenium operation. thread. sleep() will set up wait only for once when called.

What is the difference between GET () and navigate () to () method?
Image result
navigate().to() navigates to the page by changing the URL like doing forward/backward navigation. Whereas, get() refreshes the page to changing the URL

driver.get() : It's used to go to the particular website , But it doesn't maintain the browser History and cookies so , we can't use forward and backward button , if we click on that , page will not get schedule

driver.navigate() : it's used to go to the particular website , but it maintains the browser history and cookies, so we can use forward and backward button to navigate between the pages during the coding of Testcase

How to handle window handles in Selenium?

16)How does XPath work in Selenium?
  XPath is a technique in Selenium to navigate through the HTML structure of a page. 
  XPath enables testers to navigate through the XML structure of any document, 
  and this can be used on both HTML and XML documents.

  xpath or xml path is a query language for selecting nodes from xml documents.
  xpath is one of the locators supported by selenium webdriver

  ABSOLUTE XPATH:
   An absolute xpath is a way of locating an element using an xml expression beginning from root node. 
   i.e html node in case of web pages.The main disadvantange of absolute xpath is that even with slightest change 
   in the UI or any element the whole absolute xpath fails
   Example:-html/body/div/div[2]/div/div/div/div[1]/div/input

   difference b/w sinlge(/) and double slash(//)in xpath?
     in XPath a single slash is used for creating xpath with absolute paths beginning from root node.
     Whereas double slash is used for creating relative xpaths

    which xpath you will prefer to use?why?
     Normally we prefer to use Relative xpath
     Relative xpath can identit element eventhough some UI changes happened,
     it but can't identify by absolute xpath
                                                         
     what is the difference between absolte xpath and relative xpath/
      Absolute xpath will traverse entire HTML from the root node/html.
      Relative xpath directly jump to node based on attribute specified. 


17)The major disadvantage of using Absolute XPath Expressions is 'Due to small changes in the UI, 
  the Absolute XPath Expression of a UI element may change and won't work.

18)diff between class and objects?
  Object is an instance of a class. Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created. 
  Object is a real world entity such as pen, laptop, mobile, bed, keyboard, mouse, chair etc. 
  Class is a group of similar objects
 
20)What is XML is used for? 
  XML (Extensible Markup Language) is used to describe data. The XML standard is a flexible way to create information formats 
  and electronically share structured data via the public internet, 
  as well as via corporate networks.

 POM
 Page Object Model, also known as POM, is a design pattern in Selenium 
 that creates an object repository for storing all web elements. 
 It is useful in reducing code duplication and improves test case maintenance.
 In Page Object Model, consider each web page of an application as a class file.

21)DOM
  DOM stands for Document Object Model. In the world of web, all HTML webpages are referred to as documents.
  The Document Object Model represents each of these web pages in a tree-like structure to make it easier to access
  and manage the elements..
 
22)What is a Test case?
  A test case has components that describe input, action, and an expected response, 
              in order to determine if a feature of an application works
              correctly.
  A test case is a set of instructions on “HOW” to validate a particular test objective/target, 
  which, when followed will tell us if the expected behavior of the system is satisfied or not.

23)What is change request and feature request?
  A change request is a proposal from a stakeholder in the software development process to change
  something in a product or in a product process. 
  Common change requests include defects and requests for product enhancements or new features.

24)What is JavascriptExecutor in Selenium? 
  JavascriptExecutor is an interface that is used to execute 
 JavaScript with Selenium. To simplify the usage of JavascriptExecutor in Selenium,
 think of it as a medium that enables the WebDriver to interact with HTML elements within the browser.

25)get.windowhandle(): This method helps to get the window handle of the current window
get.windowhandles(): This method helps to get the handles of all the windows opened

What are the four basic principles of OOPS?
The four basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming System are listed below:

Abstraction: Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. 
For example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.
Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

Inheritance: Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms.
So polymorphism means many forms.                                                                        


Explanation:

First preference: Non-prioritized methods: ‘c’ and ‘b’: Based on alphabetical order ‘b’ was executed first and then ‘c’.

Second preference: Prioritized methods: ‘a’, ‘e’ and ‘d’: ‘e’ was executed first as it was having highest priority(0). 
As the priority of ‘a’ and ‘d’ methods were same, testng considered the alphabetical order of their methods names.
So, between them, ‘a’ was executed first and then ‘d’.

22)s/w
 Software testing is the process of finding errors in the developed product. 
 It also checks whether the real outcomes can match expected results,
 as well as aids in the identification of defects, missing requirements, or gaps.

 What is the difference between the STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) and SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?
SDLC deals with development/coding of the software while STLC deals with validation and verification of the software


Regression testing:
 Regression testing is a type of software testing. Test cases are re-executed to check 
  the previous functionality of the application is working fine, and the new changes have not produced any bugs. 
(If any new functionalities had been added  then we need to cross check the existing functionality)

Re-Testing
When the developer has fix the bug then the testing point we need to the confirmation testing

LEVELS OF TESTING
Unit-testing
checks if s/w components are fulfilling the functionalities or not

Integration testing
Check the data flow from one module to another modules

System testing       
Evaluates both functional and non functional needs for the testing

Acceptance Testing
Checks the requirements of a specification or contract are met as per as delivery.

Alpha testing
No of users involves in developer side

Beta testing       
No of users involve in Client side.

Static testing
Testing an application without executing the code. EG(Conducting Reviews)

Dynamic Testing
Testing an application with executing the code. EG(functional and non functional testing).

Verification
Am i building the right product
It determine whether it meets the clients specification.

Validation.
Am i building the product right
It determine whether it meets the End User Needs.

23)Selenium:
  What is Selenium?
  Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. 
  It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming languages
  like Ruby, Java, NodeJS, PHP, Perl, Python, and C#, among others.

 24)Appium
  	 Appium is an open source automation tool for running scripts and testing native applications, 
  mobile-web applications and hybrid applications on Android or iOS using a webdriver. 

25)Webdriver

   Selenium WebDriver is a web framework that permits you to execute cross-browser tests. 
   Selenium webdriver is A low-level interface for providing virtualized device input actions to the web browser.
   This tool is used for automating web-based application testing to verify that it performs expectedly.
   Selenium WebDriver allows you to choose a programming language to create test scripts

26)What does a framework mean in Selenium?
   Selenium is a framework used to test web applications. 
   A framework defines rules that are followed to achieve particular results

27)Locators
   Locators are the way to identify an HTML element on a web page,
   and almost all UI automation tools provide the capability to use locators 
   for the identification of HTML elements on a web page. 

28)Grid
  What is Selenium Grid?
  Selenium Grid is a smart proxy server that makes it easy to run tests in parallel on multiple machines. 
  This is done by routing commands to remote web browser instances, where one server acts as the hub. 
  This hub routes test commands that are in JSON format to multiple registered Grid nodes.

28)What is black box testing? What are the different black box testing techniques?
  Black box testing is the software testing method which is used to test the software 
  without knowing the internal structure of code or program.    
  This testing is usually done to check the functionality of an application.

6. What is white box testing and list the types of white box testing?
  White box testing technique involves selection of test cases based on an analysis of the internal structure 
  (Code coverage, branches coverage,  paths coverage, condition coverage,    etc.) of a component or system.
  It is also known as Code-Based testing or Structural testing. Different types  of white box testing are

*Statement Coverage
*Decision Coverage
   
* Important differences: Smoke vs Sanity testing
Smoke Testing is performed to ascertain that the critical functionalities of the program are working fine. 
Sanity testing is done at random to verify that each functionality is working as expected.

29)What is TestNG for Selenium?
 TestNG in Selenium is a Java testing framework, inspired by JUnit and NUnit.
 It overcomes the constraints and disadvantages of JUnit and introduces an entirely new set of properties, 
 making TestNG more powerful and easy to use.

30)Regression testing->

 31)                     Alpha Testing	                                           Beta Testing
This testing is performed by the employees of the organization	 This testing is done by clients who are not part of the  organization.                                                                                                                                                                        
This kind of testing requires a specific environment for testing.	This does not require any environment for testing.
Robustness and security test is not performed in alpha testing	 These parameters are checked during beta testing.
It is performed before the product launches into the market.	 It is performed at the time of product marketing.

32)junit
JUnit is a simple framework to write repeatable tests. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks. 

33)Unit testing->check the data flow from one module to another module.
 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
Equal to a == b
Not Equal to: a != b
You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

Java has the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

Short Hand If...Else
There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands.

It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line, and is most often used to replace simple if else statements:

Syntax
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue :  expressionFalse;
Instead of writing:

Example
int time = 20;
if (time < 18) {
  System.out.println("Good day.");
} else {
  System.out.println("Good evening.");
}



for each loop:
There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array:

Syntax
for (type variableName : arrayName) {
  // code block to be executed
}
eg:
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (String i : cars) {
  System.out.println(i);
}

What is performance testing example?eru
Performance Testing is the process of analyzing the quality and capability of a product. 
It is a testing method performed to determine the system performance in terms of speed, 
reliability and stability under varying workload. Performance testing is also known as Perf Testing.

What are types of performance testing?
Demystifying the Six Major Types of Performance Testing
Stress Testing. This test pushes an application beyond normal load conditions to determine which components fail first. ...
Spike Testing. ...
Load Testing. ...
Endurance Testing. ...
Volume Testing. ...
Scalability Testing.

Which tool is used for performance testing?
JMeter is a popular open-source load and performance testing tool. 
It can examine and benchmark a wide variety of software, including networks and servers. 
It is usually used to test web service applications for the load.
Incorporate JMeter, a Java platform application.
                                                                
What Are the Best Practices for Writing Quality Test Cases?
Keep things simple and transparent.
Make test cases reusable.
Keep test case IDs unique.
Peer review is important.
Test cases should have the end user or defined requirements in mind.
Specify expected results and assumptions.         

Typically, regression testing is applied under these circumstances:
A new requirement is added to an existing feature.
A new feature or functionality is added.
The codebase is fixed to solve defects.
The source code is optimized to improve performance.
Patch fixes are added.
Changes in configuration.


5 Things To Keep In Mind While Doing Regression Testing
First, work on recent changes in code or functionality of the software as chances of bugs in them is more. You should maintain proper documentation of all the changes so that; you can use this record to know the test cases which you can use for regression testing later.
There is the probability that some regression testing might take more time for proper execution in such cases, and you should prioritise test cases, first select those test cases which are of high priority for your client. 
With changes in technology, testing is becoming complex with time, so many times while executing complex testing cases; software gets crashes, so make sure that you include complex testing in the regression testing suite.
First, check the areas or codes which has been detecting bugs frequently; execute regression testing first on those codes as there are chances of getting bugs in those areas.
Select test cases according to business needs. Even if it’s a minor bug like an issue in some font or spelling mistake or issue in the logo; but for your client, it’s of high priority as its about the image of software.



How do I run a test case multiple times in Selenium Webdriver?
First, create a TestNG class file and add all the required annotations. 
Identify that @Test annotation which you want to run multiple times. 
Once you identified the @Test annotation then design the test format as below. 
Here we use keyword named as invocationCount with some numeric value
@Test(invocationCount = 10)
public void testCount() {..}
